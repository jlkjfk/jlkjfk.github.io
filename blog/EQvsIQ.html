             <p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) generally refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.<br> 
              It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behavior. In general, if you have a high EQ, you may find it easier to: </p> 
              <ul>
                <li> identify emotions in yourself and others </li>
                <li> empathize with other people </li>
                <li> adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations </li>
                <li> control your impulses </li>
                <li> withstand temptations and delay gratification </li>
                <li> resolve conflicts with others </li>
                <li> communicate effectively </li>
              </ul>

             <p>Your IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the most common elements of your IQ include your ability to:</p>
             <ul>
              <li> use logic to solve problems </li>
              <li> plan and strategize </li>
              <li> understand abstract ideas </li>
              <li> learn and adapt to change </li>
              <li> grasp and use language</li>
              
            </ul>
          <p>
            Historically, scores on IQ tests have been linked to better academic performance, higher salaries, and better job performance.<br>
            But today experts recognize that IQ is not the only determinant of life success. Instead, it is part of a complex array of influencesâ€”one that includes emotional intelligence. <br>
            Many companies now mandate emotional intelligence training and use EQ tests as part of the hiring process.
