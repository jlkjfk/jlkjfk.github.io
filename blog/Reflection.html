    <h1>Reflection on Foundations</h1>
    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      Through practice the growth mindset and meditation, I can now keep optimistic under pressure and have a positive attitude to all the workload. <br>
      At the first two weeks I tend to compare my learning progress to others, and being frustrated when I'm falling behind. I realised the negative emotion makes me can’t focus on my study and decrease efficiency. <br>
      I tend to do a lot of research into the topics before trying it out, which sometimes waste time as I can’t remember all the new knowledge when I try to recall them. <br>
      It also confuse me when I am coding as there’s so many unlinked ideas in my brain, but I can’t work out the logic between them. 


    </p>
    
    
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
       <p>Neuroplasticity and growth mindset are the most surprising part. </p>   
      
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
       <p>I found reflection and writing the weekly blogs are the most challenging aspects. I tried to avoid leave perfunctory remarks, but sometimes it’s really difficult to write in details.</p>


    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>
      As stated in the handbook: "Tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They're looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team". <br>
      Soft skills play a critical role in the workplace, the ones who have good soft skills are more likely to be successful.  <br>
      Programming is a type of profession where we need good teamwork and communication skills. Critical thinking ability helps us to look at a problem from multiple perspectives using the available information to get a solution that covers different aspects of the issue.<br>
      Learning to be self-aware and grounded through the core study, we have the opportunities to learn ourself and develop a positive mindset, which helps us to handle pressure. 
    </p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>
      I really appreciate the core learning which is a great way to learn about myself, to think about something I never thought, and to develop a growth mindset. <br>
      I may either give up or being extremely frustrated without the core learning, and telling myself that programming is not for me. By practice growth mindset, I can now hear a voice from my head saying “I just can’t do it <b>yet</b>.<br>
      Don’t compare to others, keep learning and practice, a small improvements everyday will lead to huge results.”
