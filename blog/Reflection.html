    <h1>Reflection on Foundations</h1>
    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      Through practice the growth mindset and meditation, I can now keep optimistic under pressure and have a positive attitude to all the workload. <br>
      At the first two weeks I tend to compare my learning progress to others, and being frustrated when I'm falling behind. I realised the negative emotion makes me can’t focus on my study and decrease efficiency. <br>
      I tend to do a lot of research into the topics before trying it out, which sometimes waste time as I can’t remember all the new knowledge when I try to recall them. <br>
      It also confuse me when I am coding as there’s so many unlinked ideas in my brain, but I can’t work out the logic between them.

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
       <p>Neuroplasticity and growth mindset are the most surprising part. </p>   
      
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
       <p>I found reflection and writing the weekly blogs are the most challenging aspects.</p>


    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
