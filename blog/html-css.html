      <h1> Best practices associated with using classes vs. ids </h1>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is:
      </p>
        <span>- <em>CSS</em> class applies a style to multiple elements. </span><br>
        <span>- <em>ID</em> applies a style to one unique element. </span><br>
        <span>- <em>ID</em> is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element </span>
    <p>
      The id selector allows you to define style rules that apply to a <b>single</b> element on the web page. Each web page can only have one element with a single <b>ID attribute</b> . <br>
      This means the ID selector can never be used to style more than one element.<br>
      ID selectors are defined using a hash sign. They are immediately followed by the ID value that you want to apply a set of style rules to.<br>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      A class selector allows you to define style rules that apply to <b>any element</b> with a class attribute equal to a certain value.<br>
      If you apply a style using a class selector, any element which shares that class will be subject to the styles you define.<br>

      Class selectors are defined using a period, followed by the value of the class that you want to apply a set of styles to.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the browser, classes have no special function. Their main purpose is to allow you to apply styles to a range of elements on a web page. <br>
      IDs, on the other hand, can be used by the browser to navigate to a certain part of the web page.<br>

If you assign an element an ID, you can use a special URL to link directly to that element. This behavior works because IDs are unique on a web page.
