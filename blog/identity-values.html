      <h1>identity-values</h1>
      <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h2>
      <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      <p>
        Coming from Chinese background, some of the values definitely has influenced my own personality and the way how I work with others. <br>
        From my culture, one of the most important values I have learnt is that learning is endless. Therefore, I am always curious about the thing I am not familiar with<br>
        and challenging myself to jump out of my comfort zone to learn new stuff. It is one of the key motivation bringing me to this course.<br>
        Also, when working in a group, I am humble and kind and always listen to others opinion. It is beneficial to build up a good relationship with my team members;<br>
        however, it also mean when there is a conflict, sometimes I am not that confident of expressing my own opinion.<br>
        I am working on finding a balance valuing myself as an individual and being a great group member. 
      </p>
      <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
      <p>
        For future career development, with the improving of technology, I believe it will be ongoing learning process when working in the tech industry.<br> 
        Being curiosity ensures me learning the most up-to-date technology. Highly concentration on the task is also a great advantage which ensures my design meets the needs from the customer efficiently. <br>
        I understand that I could not be perfect on everything. It brings me thinking of how to prioritise tasks I have been given and how to balance everything.<br>
        I think I will still try to do my best but, over the past few year, I get to know that learning from process can be more meanful than a perfect result. I think that is also why reflection is so important. 
      </p>
      <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles</h2>
      <p>
        My concentration to detail can be an advantage in my learning journey as coding needs to pay attention to details.<br>
        Being curious and passionate about what I am learning avoids me giving up in the middle of the learning and encourages me to update myself to the latest information in my area.<br>
        When facing obstacles, I always try several ways, doing research and finding out answers on Discord, or asking for help from my tutor and classmates.<br>
        It is not just I learnt from the result, but also the way seeking for the answer is important. 
      </p>

      <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
      <p>
        When I had a group project working with three other team members, different time management strategies became a barrier towards working productively.<br>
        The strategy I used at that time is that we set up a group meeting to clearly discuss what individually the timetable of the project would look like. Also, each one in the group clearly expresses the reason and the flexibility of the schedule. <br>
        Finally, we come up with a plan everyone in the group agrees with. We set up multiple tasks to finish during each stage and set up a deadline for each stage instead of a deadline for each tasks. We allow some flexibility but ensure the project can be done on time.<br>
        What I learnt from that experience is that clear communication is a key to ensure the efficiency of group work, which I could use in the future.
