      <h1>Learning-plan</h1>
  <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

  <p>My long-time goal is to have a career that provides me with the flexibility of time and working location <br>
    and also allows me to apply my creativity to the projects.<br>
    I understand that working as an IT professional can be challenging and requires lifelong learning, however,<br>
    the achievement of task completion is a huge motivation to me, which makes me feel enjoyable.  </p>

  <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning.</h2>
  <p>strengths:</p>
  <p>I am a self-motivated person. In terms of learning, I am curious and passionate about learning new knowledge. <br>
    Also, when I am struggle with any issue, I will not give up. Instead, I always try different ways to figure out the best solution.<br>
     I am also a highly focused person. I can always pay attention to the details and concentrate on my tasks which help me to achieve my goal efficiently. 
  </p>
<p>limitations: </p>
<p>To be always perfect, on the other hand, could limit my performance. Sometime, I may be struggle about if I need to jump out of my comfort zone <br>
  to challenge myself doing what I am not that good at. <br>
  The other limitation is that it can take time for me to bravely express my idea and my concern when working in a group.<br>
  I know communication is important; however, a fear of facing conflict and being shy of expressing myself are the main barrier for me to get close to people. <br>
  This has an impact on my learning, especially when discussing a topic with my classmates or asking questions through Discord. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past few year, I get to know that learning from process can be more meanful than a perfect result. I think that is also why reflection is so important.
  </p>
  <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p>
     One of the skills I would like to build up is keeping confident when I am under pressure.<br>
     As I have mentioned, I am a perfectionist, I used to put too much pressure on myself to achieve my goal perfectly.<br>
     I may self-question whether there might be a better one to achieve my goal. However, during the course, I would like to build up my confidence when facing pressure.<br>
     I think it is even more important to solidify my mind when facing pressure. </p>

  <p>
    The other skill I would like to develop is to be more extravert when facing an issue.<br>
    I felt shy and was afraid of asking for help when I got stuck on a question. I want to develop the skill of asking for help when needed.<br>
   No question is a silly question when people are learning a new skill; therefore, I need to be braver next time to yell out for the help. 

  </p>
  <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
  <p>
    I will treat this program as a full-time job, and work on Sat/Sun to catch up if I’m behind.<br>
    I will discuss the issue with some of my fellow students and will also reach out to my facilitator if I’m struggling.<br>
    If things start building up and are starting to get to me I will take a break to refresh my brain <br>
    and take a step back to reflect on what I am struggled with and how I could solve the issue.
  </p>

  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
  <p>
    I will try to research the online resources such as google and YouTube.<br>
    I will use Discord to search for the answers to the questions which are similar to mine.<br>
    If there is no similar question post on Discord, I will raise my questions and I will be very open-minded to discuss any responses. 
  </p>

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
  <p>
    The facilitation team is doing a great job and sometimes I even see replies from them after hours.<br>
    It could be helpful if they can share some personal coding experiences and how they went through the tough times.
  </p>
  <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
  <p>
    As I have mentioned, I treat this course as a full-time job, I block at least 8 hours of studying every day. 
  </p>
