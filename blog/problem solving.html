    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2>A time when I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
<p>
  As a beginner, I have been blocked on simple problems many times. <br>
  For example, when I was doing the FizzBuzz challenge: I had written out all the code with confidence, and passed “FizzBuzz” parts. However, I can’t pass “super_fizzbuzz” part after I tried to run the program at least 3 times.<br>
  I used pseudocode techniques to break the problem into smaller pieces, and searched YouTube for other solutions. I tried multiple times, the code seems correct but it keeps return error message. <br>
  I felt quite frustrating and decided to take a break. Within two minutes after I comeback, I realized that it should be “;” instead of “,” in the for loop. I felt so stupid but still gratified that I was on the right track. <br>
  A very similar story happened when I used “getElementsById” instead of “getElementById” in another challenge, luckily a codefella pointed it out. 

</p>
<h2>What I learnt</h2>
<p>I learned that I should keep calm when facing challenges and check the typo if there’s any error message. The mindset can help to minimise negative emotion, and help us to keep calm.  </p>
