    <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>	JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements. It can be compared to the body’s ability to perform actions such as walking or talking. JavaScript can also be compared to a fully functional body that has the ability to interact. </p>
    <p>An HTML only website has all of its body parts, although it doesn’t offer much to look at because it doesn’t have any accessories or personal style. At this stage, it’s also a body which is not capable of moving or speaking. </p>  
    <p>CSS can be compared to adding personal style to the body. When you link CSS to HTML, it’s like dressing up the body. </p>
      
    
    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
    <p>
      Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to bottom, starts from the first line and ends at the last line. Loops are iteration statements that will keep running until there is either nothing left to loop over, or if the condition becomes false.<br>

       For example, we normally follow a certain process when we making a pizza: prepare ingredients, make a pizza dough, add base sauce, add toppings, and then put the pizza into oven. Every pizza made under same process unless someone complaint he is allergy to one of the ingredients, then we have to recall and check each process until we find out which ingredient caused the allergy.

    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h2>
    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h2>
