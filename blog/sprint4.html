    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h2>The principles of neuroplasticity</h2>
       <p>	
          Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, is a term that refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience.<br>
          Plasticity refers to the brain's malleability, which is defined as being "easily influenced, trained, or controlled."<br>
           Neuro refers to neurons, the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system. Thus, neuroplasticity is when nerve cells change or adjust.
       </p>
       <p>There are two main types of neuroplasticity:</p>
       <p>
         Functional plasticity: the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas<br>
         Structural plasticity: the brain's ability to actually change its physical structure as a result of learning
       </p>
       <p><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">Here</a> is an article which explains neuroplasticity.

    <h2>Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
       <p>
          Enriching your environment, for example learning a new language, traveling, creating art and other creative pursuits;<br>
          Getting plenty of rest;<br>
          Excercising regularly.

    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h2>

    <p>DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document.<br>
       We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
    The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element. <br>
    Our document is called the root node and contains one child node which is the<em>html</em>element. <br>
    The <em>html</em> element contains two children which are the<em>head</em> and<em>body</em> elements.<br>
    Both the<em>head</em> and<em>body</em> elements have children of their own.</p>

<p>There are several ways to access elements in the DOM: by ID, class, tag, and query selectors.</p>

    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
   <p> When you create an array it contains value index numerically (starts at “0”), so if you wanted to access an array element then you need to specify array index.<br>
     We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable.<br>
      Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list. <br>
Objects are mutable data structure in JavaScript which is used to represent a ‘Thing’. This could be anything like cars, plants, person, community etc.
</p>

    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h2>
    <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. <br>
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().<br>
Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program easy to understand and reusable.<br>
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.</p>
<p>Functions are helpful<bold>because</bold> they make the code reusable. You can declare it once and use it multiple times.<br>
  Function makes the program easier as each small task is divided into a function, and it increased readability.</p>
