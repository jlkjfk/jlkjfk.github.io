    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h2>The principles of neuroplasticity</h2>
       <p>	
          Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, is a term that refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience.<br>
          Plasticity refers to the brain's malleability, which is defined as being "easily influenced, trained, or controlled."<br>
           Neuro refers to neurons, the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system. Thus, neuroplasticity is when nerve cells change or adjust.
       </p>
       <p>There are two main types of neuroplasticity:</p>
       <p>
         Functional plasticity: the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas<br>
         Structural plasticity: the brain's ability to actually change its physical structure as a result of learning

     <h2>How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h2>
       <p>
        The relation between neuroplasticity and our learning  journey is an easy one to surmise: when we learn, we form new pathways in the brain. <br>
        Each new knowledge has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain’s default mode of operation. Study programming is similar to how we learn to drive,<br> 
        the repeatedly practice helps to recall and form new pathway in our brainy.

    <h2>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h2>

      <p>
      A person with a growth mindset believes that he or she can get smarter, better, or more skilled at something through sustained effort—which is exactly what neuroplasticity tells us.<br> 
      You might say that a growth mindset is simply accepting the idea of neuroplasticity on a broad level!
